**Multi-Dimensional Dynamic Array for Music Playlist**
**Data Structures and Algorithms Assignment 1
Muhammad Hammad**

Implementation of a multi-dimensional dynamic array data structure to create and manage a music playlist. 
This data structure should fulfill all the basic operations of an array data structure, with each element representing a song in the playlist.

**Assignment Requirements**

**Part 1: Implementation**
1. **Initialization**: Create an empty music playlist.
2. **Add Song**: Add a new song to the playlist. Each song should have attributes such as title, artist,
album, and duration.
3. **Access Song**: Retrieve information about a specific song in the playlist, given its position.
4. **Update Song**: Modify the details of a song (e.g., title, artist, album, duration) in the playlist.
5. **Delete Song**: Remove a song from the playlist.
6. **Size**: Get the current size (number of songs) of the playlist.
7. **Is Empty**: Check if the playlist is empty.

**Part 2: Management**
**Challenge 1**: Playlist Reordering
Implement a function to allow users to reorder the songs in the playlist. Users should be able to move a
song from one position to another within the playlist.
**Challenge 2**: Playlist Sorting
Implement a function to sort the playlist based on one of the song attributes (e.g., title, artist, duration).
Users should be able to choose the sorting criteria.
**Complex Problem**: Playlist Recommendations [Bonus Marks]
Design and implement a function that provides playlist recommendations based on the user's listening
history. This function should consider factors like the user's favorite artists, genres, and previously played
songs to suggest new songs to add to the playlist.
